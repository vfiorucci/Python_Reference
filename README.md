## Dictionaries:
    (dicts) are a central data structure. Dicts store an arbitrary number of objects, each 
    identified by a unique dictionary key. They are also often called maps, hashmaps, lookup tables, or 
    associative arrays. Dictionaries can be created by placing a comma-separated list of key: value pairs 
    within braces, for example: {'jack': 4098, 'sjoerd': 4127} or {4098: 'jack', 4127: 'sjoerd'}, or by 
    the dict constructor.
