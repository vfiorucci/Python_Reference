## Dictionaries:
Dicts are a central data structure. Dicts store an arbitrary number of objects, each 
identified by a unique dictionary key. They are also often called maps, hashmaps, lookup tables, or 
associative arrays. Dictionaries can be created by placing a comma-separated list of key: value pairs 
within braces.

    Example: 
        employee = {4098: 'jack', 4127: 'sjoerd'}
        Key is number
        Value is name
